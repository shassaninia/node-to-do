We do not want to have all our code in one js file (module), so we typically split our code up into modules
and require the ones that we need.

To use a module in another module, we require it by using the 'require(...)' function and we pass in the module we
require to use.  For example, if there is a module called counter.js and I want to use it in app.js, I would need to
require counter.js in app.js by doing:

    require('./count');

The js extension is optional

In order for other modules to be called by others, we need to export what we want to be available.
So, if we want to make a counter function available, we will do:

module.exports = counter;

Now counter will be available when we require it in another file.
